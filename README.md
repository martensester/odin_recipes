# odin_recipes

This is the first project on "The Odin Project", learning HTML. I am not new to HTML at all, but it is nice to go over the basics again. I might learn something new.

It is a very basic project, just creating an HTML document about recipes.

Self reflection:

I used some basic CSS just to make the images normal size, they were huge. Didn't learn anything new really, but it was good to do something basic, practise is always good. 
Took me around 5 minutes.
